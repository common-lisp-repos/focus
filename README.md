FoCus is a wrapper around the standard FORMAT utility. It allows you to
customize the FORMAT DSL by adding new directive characters or modifying the
standard ones. The semantics of these directive characters is specified in a
so-called "format table", a concept very close to that of readtables. FoCus
ultimately translates into regular FORMAT calls.

contains a lot of resources, including online documentation in various
formats.
